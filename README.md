# Bilingualism, Aging, and Executive Functions: A Master's Thesis Project

This repository contains code, data, and statistical analyses for my master's thesis in psychology.  
The project examines the relationship between bilingualism, executive functions, emotional regulation, the aging effectand, and  well-being across younger and older adults, using a combination of behavioral tasks and self-report instruments.


## 📖 About the project
Learning to code statistics for my master thesis in psychology.  
My name is Kristell Maria Karlsson, currently a Master student of Psychology at UiT—Norges Arktiske Universitet i Tromsø.  
Here I will try to code and calculate almost all statistics needed for the thesis.
Statistical calculations like mixed ANOVAs designs, visualizations and other regression analysis.

This repository contains code, data, and analysis for my master's thesis in psychology.  
The project investigates bilingualism, executive functions, and aging using “Classical Stroop” and “Emotional Stroop” tasks.

This research is a collaboration between two faculties: the Psychology department and the Language and Culture department here in UiT.  
The lab where the data collection occurred was in the PolaRLab in Tromsø located at the Language and Culture department.  
It focuses on Norwegian, Tromsø inhabitants with their mother tongue Norwegian, and second language English.
