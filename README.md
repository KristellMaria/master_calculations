# Master Thesis Statistical Calculations
Learning to code statistics for my master thesis in psychology. 
My name is Kristell Maria Karlsson, and I am currently a Master student of Psychology at UiT-Norges Arktiske Universitet i Tromsø.
Here I will try to code and calculate almost all my statistics needed for the thesis. 

This research is a collaboration between two faculties. The Psychology department, and the Language and Culture department here in UiT. 
The lab which the collection of data occured was in the PolarLab in Tromsø located at the Language and Culture department. 
It focuses on Norwegian, Tromsø inhabitants with their mothertounge Norwegian, and second language English.
