## About the project
Learning to code statistics for my master thesis in psychology.  
My name is Kristell Maria Karlsson, currently a Master student of Psychology at UiT—Norges Arktiske Universitet i Tromsø.  
Here I will try to code and calculate almost all statistics needed for the thesis.

This research is a collaboration between two faculties: the Psychology department and the Language and Culture department here in UiT.  
The lab where the data collection occurred was in the PolaRLab in Tromsø located at the Language and Culture department.  
It focuses on Norwegian, Tromsø inhabitants with their mother tongue Norwegian, and second language English.
